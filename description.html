    <h1> BRIEF DESCRIPTION ABOUT THE LANGUAGE</h1>
    <P>
        <h1>HINDI</h1>
        The Hindi language is a direct descendant of Sanskrit and dates back to 769 AD. The language gained prominence over time, 
        known initially as Old Hindi and spoken in the areas around Delhi. It is the earliest stage of the Delhi dialect, serving
         as the ancestor both for Modern Hindi and Urdu. This first version of the language was written in the Devanagari script.

Between the 8th and 10th centuries (during the time of Islamic invasions and the formation of Muslim control in Northern India), 
the Afghans, Persians, and Turks adopted Old Hindi as a shared tongue of interaction with the local populace around Delhi. With time, 
the language evolved and adopted loanwords from Arabic and Persian. They account for around 25% of Hindi vocabulary today!

Speaking and learning Hindi as a first language was popular in the 13th and 15th centuries, around the same time that early 
Hindi writing in literature surfaced. Examples of famous literature written in the Hindi language include Prithviraj Raso and 
the works of Amir Khusrow. This version of the language went by several different names over the years, including Hindi, Hindustani, 
Dahlavi, and Hindavi, or –more simply – the language of India.

        <h1>English</h1>
        English is a West Germanic language that evolved from the dialects spoken by early Germanic tribes in what is now present-day England and southern Scotland. 
        It has undergone significant changes over the centuries, influenced by various languages due to historical events like the Norman Conquest in 1066.
        English is one of the most widely spoken languages in the world. It is the primary language in many countries, including the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. 
        Additionally, it's often used as a second or foreign language in many other countries due to its status as a global lingua franca.
        English has a diverse vocabulary due to its history of borrowing words from other languages. It has a large number of words compared to many other languages, making it versatile for expressing different concepts. 
        English grammar is characterized by its relatively simple inflectional system compared to some other languages.

        <h1>Chinese</h1>
        Chinese is a member of the Sino-Tibetan language family. It has a complex system of characters and tones that distinguish it from many other languages.
        Chinese has several major dialect groups, the most prominent being Mandarin, Cantonese, Wu, Min, and Hakka. Mandarin, also known as Standard Chinese, is the official language of China and is used as a lingua franca for communication among speakers of different dialects.
        One of the most distinctive features of Chinese is its writing system, which uses characters (hanzi) to represent words or concepts. Each character generally represents a syllable and often carries a meaning on its own.
        The characters can be logographic, where they represent meanings, and phonetic, where they provide clues to pronunciation.
        Mandarin Chinese is a tonal language, which means that the pitch or tone in which a word is spoken can change its meaning. Mandarin has four main tones and a neutral tone, each of which conveys a different semantic distinction.

        <h1>French</h1>

        French is spoken as a first language in countries such as France, Canada (particularly in the province of Quebec), Belgium, Switzerland, and various African nations. 
        It's also spoken as a second language in many parts of the world due to its historical influence and the international importance of French culture.
        French culture has had a profound impact on the arts, philosophy, cuisine, fashion, and literature. 
        France is known for its contributions to global cinema, literature (from classic authors like Victor Hugo to contemporary writers), and fine arts.
